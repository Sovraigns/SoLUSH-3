# SoLUSH: Running Intelligence On-Chain

In decentralized finance, systems often involve tasks such as determining optimal liquidity ranges for automated market makers, allocating staking rewards in a way that balances fairness and participation incentives, or dynamically adjusting collateralization ratios to minimize risks in lending protocols. These challenges are critical for ensuring the efficiency and stability of protocols, yet they are particularly difficult to address without centralization. Off-chain solutions often rely on external computation and centralized entities or oracles, introducing trust dependencies and undermining the decentralized ethos of blockchain systems.

Artificial intelligence is increasingly being explored in decentralized finance to enhance token ecosystems and liquidity management. This shift represents a practical application of AI tools aimed at addressing complex optimization problems directly within blockchain ecosystems. While large language models (LLMs) dominate discussions around AI innovation due to their general-purpose capabilities, they are poorly suited to the demands of decentralized adaptive systems. In contrast, **genetic algorithms** (GAs) offer a more natural and efficient fit for systems requiring iterative improvements, combining computational simplicity with adaptive behavior.

## **Introduction to Genetic Algorithms**

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are optimization techniques inspired by the process of natural selection. They operate by evolving a population of candidate solutions over multiple generations, using mechanisms such as mutation, crossover, and selection.

- **Population:** A set of potential solutions to a problem.
- **Fitness Function:** A way to evaluate how well each solution performs.
- **Selection:** The process of choosing the best-performing solutions to carry forward.
- **Crossover and Mutation:** Methods to combine and modify solutions, creating new ones that explore the problem space.

Through repeated iterations, GAs converge toward optimal or near-optimal solutions, making them highly effective for solving complex, dynamic problems. GAs have recently gained momentum with the development of the [Push 3 language](http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push3-description.html) by Lee Spector. Push 3’s compact and efficient architecture shares similarities with stack-based virtual machine systems like the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Although not designed specifically for EVMs, Push 3’s simplicity and flexibility make it conceptually compatible with blockchain execution environments. Push 3 has achieved milestones such as evolving [programs for quantum computers](https://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/aqcp/) and supporting autoconstructive evolution. A Push 3 VM could facilitate the deployment of genetic algorithms in decentralized systems, leveraging Push 3’s support for expressive program evolution and adaptive behavior in tasks like resource optimization.

## On Agents

An agent is defined as an entity capable of perceiving its environment, processing information, and taking autonomous actions to achieve specific objectives. LLMs can be structured into agents using frameworks that provide memory and feedback loops, but they do not fit on-chain and, at the same time, cannot securely manage secrets like private keys. Without either of these capabilities, LLM-based agents require external key management, increasing risks and undermining decentralized security principles. In contrast, genetic algorithms exhibit agentic characteristics by evolving their behavior over time to meet specific goals. When deployed on-chain within smart contracts, GAs can autonomously adapt to real-time inputs and optimize decisions, all while operating entirely within the secure and deterministic framework of blockchain systems.

## **Genetic Algorithms vs. LLMs for Decentralized Systems**

1. **Efficiency and Feasibility for Blockchain Execution**

   - **LLMs are resource-intensive:** The computational complexity and size of LLMs make them impractical for direct execution in decentralized environments, where every operation incurs costs. Running even the simplest inference for an LLM would require off-chain computation and trust in external oracles, undermining decentralization.
   - **GAs are lightweight:** Genetic algorithms, by design, are computationally efficient. Their iterative, population-based approach to optimization fits naturally into resource-constrained environments. This efficiency ensures GAs can evolve and execute entirely on-chain, preserving transparency and trustless execution.

2. **Evolution vs. Training**

   - **GAs evolve in parallel:** Genetic algorithms enable evolutionary processes to run across distributed populations simultaneously. This parallelism contrasts with the centralized training required for deep neural networks, which demand synchronized computation and significant infrastructure. GAs’ decentralized nature aligns well with blockchain environments.

   - **Deep neural networks require centralized training:** Neural networks demand substantial computational resources and centralized coordination to train effectively. 

3. **Auditability of Evolution vs Training**

   - **Training LLMs is opaque:** The progress of training deep neural networks is often difficult to evaluate and verify because testing its capabilities relies on secret data, which cannot be audited by external parties.
   - **GAs offer transparent evolution:** Genetic algorithms allow the progress of evolution to be easily audited against a target fitness function. This process is fully observable and can be verified at each step with minimal effort.

## **Theoretical Framework for Decentralized Genetic Programming**

A protocol providing agents as a service could leverage genetic programming to address complex problems within blockchain environments. Central to such a system would be the development of a Push 3 Virtual Machine (VM), enabling efficient execution of genetic algorithms. Furthermore, this protocol would combines on-chain smart contracts with off-chain optimization to evolve and deploy efficient algorithms for DeFi tasks.

### On-Chain: Tasks and Deployment
1. **Task Creation**: Optimization problems are registered as "Tasks" in the "Registry." Each Task includes:
   - A fitness function (goal criteria).
   - Evaluation parameters (data and conditions).
   - A population of algorithms (initially empty).
2. **Agent Deployment**: The best-performing algorithm from the population is selected and deployed to the relevant smart contract. Read through this [real-life usecase explaining the applicability of agents to DeFi](example.md). When better algorithms are discovered, the on-chain agent is updated.

### Off-Chain: Evolution and Validation
1. **Task Selection**: Optimizers (network participants) fetch a Task from the Registry.
2. **Algorithm Evolution**:
   - Optimizers run simulations locally using synthetic or historical blockchain data.
   - Genetic algorithms are applied to evolve better solutions, improving fitness scores.
3. **Submission and Validation**: Improved algorithms are submitted to a "Validator Pool," which verifies the results. Validators vote on whether to accept the new algorithm into the population, replacing weaker ones.
4. **Incentives**: Successful submissions earn rewards for the Optimizer.

### Key Components
- **Registry (on-chain)**: Manages Tasks and stores algorithm populations.
- **Optimizers (off-chain)**: Compete to evolve better solutions.
- **Validator Pool (off-chain)**: Ensures the quality and legitimacy of submissions.

This framework integrates off-chain computation with on-chain validation and deployment, ensuring scalable, transparent optimization. By decentralizing the process, it aligns incentives and fosters continuous improvement tailored to real-world DeFi needs. Ultimately, this system creates a foundation for scalable agent development, aligning with the broader concept of agents as a service, where users and protocols in DeFi can deploy and leverage optimized, evolving AI-agents tailored to specific tasks.
