# **SoLUSH**: A Push 3 Virtual Machine in Solidity

Welcome to **SoLUSH 3** (pronounced like **"slush"** without the "o", composed from **S**o**L**idity and p**USH** 3), a Solidity implementation of the [Push 3 stack machine](http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push3-description.html), designed to bring evolved genetic algorithms on-chain. By enabling the execution of Push 3 programs directly within Ethereum smart contracts, SoLush 3 paves the way for decentralized, adaptive systems to address complex optimization problems.

## üåü Vision

SoLUSH is a key step toward realizing the vision of running decentralized evolutionary computation on blockchain systems. It allows for:

- **Execution of Genetic Algorithms On-Chain:** Efficiently run evolved solutions to optimization problems entirely within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- **Decentralized Adaptive Systems:** Enable the creation of autonomous agents capable of adapting in real time based on a target fitness function.
- **Scalable Agentic Ecosystems:** Lay the groundwork for integrating evolutionary algorithms into decentralized applications (dApps).

To understand the broader vision, check out the [Vision Document](vision.md).

## üöÄ Getting Started

SoLUSH 3 is in active development. To contribute or test the functionality, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SoLUSH.git
   cd SoLUSH
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if applicable).
3. Review the examples and test cases to understand how Push 3 programs are executed on the VM.


## üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap
